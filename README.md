Common columns between these 3 files:
- Name (of the product),
- Brand,
- Country,
- Categories (Type of beer/wine/liquor)
- ABV (Alcohol by volume)
- Suggested Serving Temperature (in Fahrenheit)
- Rating (Scale 0 to 5)
- Rate count (Amount of reviews, the rating is based on)
- Price (Sometimes might be incorrect, be careful)
- Volume (Volume, the price is set for)
- Description [of a product] (Mostly descriptions, but sometimes may be filled with contacts of a brand, or company's history)

There are additional columns in every file, but names speak for themselves
